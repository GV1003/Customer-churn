# ðŸ“‰ Customer Churn Prediction with IBM Cognos

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting **customer churn** and identifying the key factors that influence **customer retention**.  
By leveraging **IBM Cognos Analytics**, the project combines **data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling** to help businesses understand why customers leave and how they can improve retention strategies.  

The ultimate goal is to **reduce attrition rates** and provide actionable insights for decision-making.  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Define analysis goals for customer churn prediction.  
- Collect and prepare customer-related data.  
- Design interactive dashboards and visualizations in **IBM Cognos**.  
- Build a **predictive model** to identify at-risk customers.  
- Highlight the most important factors driving churn and retention.  

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding customer demographics, services, and behavior.  
- **IBM Cognos Dashboards**: Visual insights into churn patterns across different customer segments.  
- **Predictive Modeling**: Identifying high-risk customers and generating retention strategies.  
- **Actionable Insights**: Recommendations for reducing churn and improving customer experience.  

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
- **IBM Cognos Analytics** â†’ Dashboards, predictive modeling, and reporting  
- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** â†’ Data preprocessing and exploration (if applicable)  
- **Data Visualization** â†’ Charts, graphs, and dashboards in Cognos  

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset includes customer information such as:  
- **Demographics** (age, gender, location)  
- **Services subscribed** (internet, phone, streaming, etc.)  
- **Account information** (tenure, contract type, billing method)  
- **Churn label** (Yes/No â€“ whether the customer has churned)  

---

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Load the dataset into **IBM Cognos Analytics**.  
2. Define analysis objectives (e.g., churn probability, key retention factors).  
3. Create **dashboards** for customer insights.  
4. Build and train the **predictive model** using Cognosâ€™ built-in tools.  
5. Interpret results and generate actionable insights.  

---

## ðŸ“š Learnings & Insights
- Customers with **month-to-month contracts** are more likely to churn.  
- **High monthly charges** and **short tenure** strongly correlate with attrition.  
- Retention strategies like discounts, loyalty programs, or longer contract incentives can help reduce churn.
